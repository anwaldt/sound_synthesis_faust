A collection of digital tools will be used to
meet, share information, material and
programming tutorials.
Most services are password-protected.
Please get in touch if you need the passwords.

------

Mailing List
============

Due to the current situation, the class will be held online. All relevant information will be distributed via a mailing list. Please subscribe to participate:

https://lists.tu-berlin.de/mailman/listinfo/ak-synth2020 

------

Zoom
====

The seminar uses a Zoom meeting as virtual
classroom for the weekly sessions. A password is required for accessing the meeting:

`Link to Zoom meeting <https://tu-berlin.zoom.us/j/95426202501?pwd=M2hDNTljQyt4K3BXd2VmS2xITEw4UT09>`_


------

Downloads
=========

Papers, sound files and other content can
be downloaded from a password-protected:

`TUB Cloud directory <https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/15ciTqneMJ6Zdky>`_.



------

Faust Code
==========

The Faust project features a rich set of properly
documented
`examples <https://faust.grame.fr/doc/examples/>`_.
Nevertheless, this class has an 
`accompanying Git Repository <https://gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/henrikvoncoler/sound_synthesis_faust>`_ for code snippets and small tutorials.

------

JupyterHub
==========

The class makes use of Jupyter Notebooks for illustrating details of
synthesis algorithms and their components.

**Repository**

Jupyter files for the class are organized in a `Git Repository <https://gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/henrikvoncoler/sound_synthesis_jupyter>`_.


**Own Jupyterlab or Jupyternotebook Instance**

You can install your own of instance of JupyterLab or JupyterNotebook,
alongside the necessary libraries and use the examples from the
repository. This is the recommended way:

https://jupyter.org/


**Using Binder**

The repository can be used with an on line service like `Binder <https://mybinder.org/>`_.


**Using the JupyterHub**

Students can sign into a  `dedicated JupyterHub <https://jupyter.hvc.berlin>`_.
This service might suffer from a large number of users.
Follow the link and create a user accout,
chosing the signup option:

https://jupyter.hvc.berlin

Your account will be activated within one day and
you can log in, using the Login option.
After logging in, write-protected example files are located in
the following directory:

::

   share/sound_synthesis_static/sound_synthesis_jupyter

**nbgitpuller**

   
To load the content of the repository to the dedicated JupyterHub,
use this link: `nbgitpuller <https://jupyter.hvc.berlin/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de%2Fhenrikvoncoler%2Fsound_synthesis_jupyter&urlpath=tree%2Fsound_synthesis_jupyter%2F>`_

The files will appear in a directory ``/sound_synthesis_jupyter``
and can be edited.



------

Wiki
====

Participants can use this Wiki as a
knowledge base for sharing examples and
tutorials:

http://wiki.hvc.berlin/

Links
=====

There are a couple of links, which reappear as references
in this lecture or can be used as additional resources.


- `CCRMA website of Julius Smith <https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/>`_

- `Faust Tutorials by Romain Michon <https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~rmichon/faustTutorials/>`_

ISIS
====

TU students additionally enroll for the class via the ISIS system
of the TU Berlin: `ISIS <https://isis.tu-berlin.de/course/view.php?id=19732>`_
